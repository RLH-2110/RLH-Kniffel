# RLH-Kniffel 

This is a small Kniffel (Yahtzee) scoring program that I privately made from a request of a person.  

The initial commit was the 5th version of the program, since I did not use git before.  

The language is German, but the code is written in English, but It's not documented, since this is a small side project.

# Compilation

currently there is no Makefile and this was only designed for windows.  
I might add a Makefile somewhere in the future, but until then you can compile it with Visual Studio.
